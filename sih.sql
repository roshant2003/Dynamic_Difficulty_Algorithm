It is the sole blood supply to the retina; it has no significant collateral circulation and blockage of this vessel leads to blindness. The branches of this aery are what you view during a fundoscopic exam. Note: The infraorbital aery is a branch of the maxillary aery. It comes through the infraorbital foramen, inferior to the eye. It supplies the maxillary sinus, the maxillary incisors, canine and premolar teeth, and the skin of the cheek below the orbit. The supraorbital aery is another branch of the maxillary aery.

This is not a good screening test but a positive result is highly specific. The best investigation would be cystoscopy & biopsy. Investigations for bladder cancer 1. Urinary cytology - Exfoliated cells from both normal and neoplastic urothelium can be readily identified in voided urine. Examination of cytological specimens can detect the malignant cells either at the time of initial presentation or during follow-up. Cytological examination may be especially useful in screening high-risk population and assessing the response to treatment. 2. Cystourethroscopy and tumor resection - The diagnosis and initial staging of bladder cancer is made by cystoscopy and transurethral resection. 3.Imaging (IVP, CT, MRI) - Although various imaging techniques can detect bladder cancer, its presence is confirmed by cystoscopy & biopsy. - Therefore imaging modalities are used to image the upper urinary tract and, when infiltrating bladder tumors are detected to assess the depth of muscle wall infiltration and the presence of local & distant metastasis. - Intravenous urography remains one of the most common imaging tests for the evaluation of hematuria. However, intravenous pyelography is increasingly being replaced by computed tomography (CT) urography, which is more accurate, for evaluation of the entire abdominal cavity, renal parenchyma, and ureters in patients with hematuria. Bladder tumors may be recognized as pedunculated, radiolucent filling defects projecting into the lumen; nonpapillary, infiltrating tumors may result in fixation or flattening of the bladder wall. 4. Urinary tumor markers - - Several new tests have been developed in order to overcome the shocomings of urinary cytology such as the low sensitivity for low-grade superficial tumors and inter-observer variability. - Commercially available tests include, the BTA test, the BTA stat test, the BTA TRAK assay determination of urinary nuclear matrix protein (NMP22), Immunocyt and UroVysion . - These tests can detect cancer specific proteins in urine (BTA/NMP22) or augment cytology by identifying cell surface or cytogenetic markers in the nucleus. Other tests under investigation include identification of the Lewis X antigen on exfoliated urothelial cells, and the determination of telomerase activity in exfoliated cells. - These tests have been demonstrated to enhance detection of bladder cancer when used either individually or in combination with cytology.

According to this hypothesis, atherosclerosis is a chronic inflammatory response of the aerial wall initiated by injury to endothelium. Pathogenesis of atherosclerosis Following stages occurs in the pathogenesis of Atherosclerosis: Endothelial injury Earliest stages of the development of atherosclerosis are mediated by the inflammatory cascade. Inflammation mediated injury to endothelium is the cornestone in the development of atherosclerosis. After injury, endothelium is activated and there is increased expression of adhesion molecule-VCAM-1 and there is increased permeability to endothelium. TNF is the major cytokine to induce this expression. Migration of leukocytes When VCAM-1 is expressed on endothelium, leukocytes adhere to the endothelium. Leukocytes than cross the endothelial barrier and begin to accumulate in subendothelial intimal space. Macrophages engulf LDL cholesterol and form foam cells - formation of earliest lesion, i.e. fatty streak. Macrophages also form oxygen free radicals that cause oxidation of LDL to yield oxidized LDL (modified LDL). Smooth muscle cell migration and proliferation Inflammatory cells in subendothelial intimal space secrete cytokines, mainly PDGF, TGF-ct and FGF which cause migration of smooth muscle cells from media to subendothelial intimal space as well as their proliferation. Maturation of plaque Smooth muscle cells synthesize extracellular matrix (especially collegen) and conve a fatty streak into a mature fibrofatty atheroma, and contribute to the progressive growth of atherosclerotic lesions.', 4, 'Smooth muscle', 'Media', 'Adventitia', 'Endothelium', 'Pathology', '', 'f94f9f8f-fb28-44f0-9381-3dca473e305d', 78, 26, '66.67', 19),

('Which of the following is not a component of transpo system?', 'Functions: Transpo Systems An essential role of biomembranes is to allow movement of all compounds necessary for the normal function of a cell across the membrane barrier. These compounds include a vast array of substances like sugars, amino acids, fatty acids, steroids, cations and anions to mention a few. These compounds must enter or leave the cells in an orderly manner for normal functioning of the cell. A. 1. Ion Channels Ion channels are transmembrane channels, pore-like structures composed of proteins. Specific channels for Na+, K+, Ca++, and Cl- have been identified. Cation conductive channels are negatively charged within the channel and have an average diameter of about 5 to 8 nm. All ion channels are basically made up of transmembrane subunits that come together to form a central pore through which ions pass selectively. All channels have gates and are controlled by opening and closing. Types of Gates Two types of gated channels. They are a. Ligand-gated channels: In this, a specific molecule binds to a receptor and opens the channel. Example: Acetylcholine receptor is present in the postsynaptic membrane. It is a complex of five subunits, having a binding site for acetylcholine. Acetylcholine released from the presynaptic region binds with the binding site of the postsynaptic region, which triggers the opening of the channel and influx of Na+. b. Voltage-gated channels: These channels open or close in response to changes in membrane potential. Some propeies of ion channels * Composed of transmembrane protein subunits. * Highly selective. * Well regulated by the presence of \"gates\". * Two main types of gates: Ligand-gated and voltage-gated. * Activities are affected by ceain drugs. * Mutations of genes encoding transmembrane proteins can cause specific diseases. 2. Ionophores Ceain microorganisms can synthesize small organic molecules, called ionophores, which function as shuttles for the movement of ions across the membrane. Structure: These ionophores contain hydrophilic centres that bind specific ions and are surrounded by peripheral hydrophobic regions. Types: Two types: (a) Mobile ion carriers: Like valinomycin (Refer uncouplers of oxidative phosphorylation). (b) Channel formers: Like gramicidin. 3. Water Channels (Aquaporins) In ceain cells, e.g. in red blood cells, and cells of the collecting ductules of the kidney, the movement of water by simple diffusion is enhanced by movements of water through water channels, composed of tetrameric transmembrane proteins called aquaporins. About five distinct types of aquaporins have been recognised. CLINICAL ASPECT Recently mutations in the gene encoding AP-2 (Aquaporin 2) protein, have been shown to be the cause of one type of nephrogenic diabetes insipidus. 4. Gap Junction Ceain cells develop specialized regions on their membranes for intercellular communications which are in close proximity. Function: They mediate and regulate the passage of ions and small molecules upto 1000 to 2000 mol wt, through a narrow hydrophilic core connecting the cytosol of adjacent cells. Structure: They are primarily composed of protein, called connexon which contains four membrane-spanning a-helices. the mitochondrial membrane also has paicularly energy coupling mechanism.Ref: MN Chatterjea Textbook of Medical Biochemistry, 8th edition', 1, 'Receptor activation', 'Selective gate', 'Non-selective channel', 'Energy coupling system', 'Biochemistry', 'Respiratory chain', 'a90571f1-9a01-4477-ab8a-5613d6dd48f9', 54, 14, '74.07', 27),

Most patients with pure or predominant AS have gradually increasing obstruction over years, but do not become symptomatic until the sixth to eighth decades. Exeional dyspnea, angina pectoris, and syncope are the three cardinal symptoms. Dyspnea results primarily from elevation of the pulmonary capillary pressure caused by elevations of LV diastolic pressures secondary to reduced left ventricular compliance and impaired relaxation. Angina pectoris usually develops somewhat later and reflects an imbalance between the augmented myocardial oxygen requirements and reduced oxygen availability. Exeional syncope may result from a decline in aerial pressure caused by vasodilation in the exercising muscles and inadequate vasoconstriction in nonexercising muscles in the face of a fixed CO, or from a sudden fall in CO produced by an arrhythmia.

MORPHOLOGY The diagnostic histopathologic feature of sarcoidosis is the noncaseating epithelioid granuloma, irrespective of the organ involved. This is a discrete, compact collection of epithelioid cells rimmed by an outer zone of largely CD4+ T cells. The epithelioid cells are derived from macrophages and are characterized by abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm and vesicular nuclei. It is not uncommon to see intermixed multinucleate giant cells formed by fusion of macrophages. A thin layer of laminated fibroblasts is present peripheral to the granuloma; over time, these proliferate and lay down collagen that replaces the entire granuloma with a hyalinized scar. Two other microscopic features are sometimes seen in the granulomas: (1) Schaumann bodies, laminated concretions composed of calcium and proteins; and (2) asteroid bodies, stellate inclusions enclosed within giant cells. Their presence is not required for diagnosis of sarcoidosis--they also may occur in granulomas of other origins. Rarely, foci of central necrosis may be present in sarcoid granulomas, suggesting an infectious process. Caseation necrosis typical of tuberculosis is absent The lungs are involved at some stage of the disease in 90% of patients. The granulomas predominantly involve the interstitium rather than air spaces, with some tendency to localize in the connective tissue around bronchioles and pulmonary venules and in the pleura (\"lymphangitic\" distribution). The bronchoalveolar lavage fluid contains abundant CD4+ T cells. In 5% to 15% of patients, the granulomas eventually are replaced by diffuse interstitial fibrosis, resulting in a so-called honeycomb lung. Intrathoracic hilar and paratracheal lymph nodes are enlarged and calcification in 75% to 90% of patients, while a third present with peripheral lymphadenopathy. The nodes are characteristically painless and have a firm, rubbery texture.

(Option a)Reduced fetal urine production may contribute to oligohydramnios and pulmonary hypoplasia.About 30% of affected neonates die shortly after birth due to respiratory insufficiency. Close to 60% of mortality occurs within the first month of life.In the classic group, most patients are bom with renal insufficiency and ESRD (End stage renal disease). (Option b)However, infants often have a transient improvement in their GFR; death from renal insufficiency at this stage is rare.Some patients are diagnosed after the neonatal stage and form the older group. Morbidity and mortality in this group often involve systemic hypertension, progressive renal insufficiency, and liver manifestations.The hallmarks of ARPKD liver disease are biliary dysgenesis due to a primary ductal plate malformation with associated periportal fibrosis, namely congenital hepatic fibrosis (CHF) and dilatation of intrahepatic bile ducts (Caroli\'s disease). CHF and Caroli\'s disease can then lead to portal hypertension exhibiting hepatosplenomegaly, variceal bleeding, and cholangitis.Some patients with the diagnosis of ARPKD at 1 year of age with nephromegaly exhibit slowly declining renal function over 20 years with only minimally enlarged kidneys at ESRD (Option c and e) and markedly atrophic kidneys following renal transplantation.The slow progression of renal disease is likely due to increasing fibrosis rather than the development of cysts.Systemic hypertension is common in all ARPKD patients, even those with normal renal function.

No mucosal ulceration is seen.', 'Gastritis is a nonspecific term that describes any inflammation of the gastric mucosa. Acute gastritis refers to the clinical situation of gastric mucosal erosions (not mucosal ulcers). Acute gastritis is also known as hemorrhagic gastritis or acute erosive gastritis. Acute gastritis is associated with the use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, such as aspirin, ibuprofen, and coicosteroids, and also with alcohol, chemotherapy, ischemia, shock, and even severe stress. Two types of stress ulcers are Curling\'s ulcers, seen in patients with severe burns, and Cushing\'s ulcers, seen in patients with intracranial lesions. Grossly acute gastritis appears as multiple, scattered, punctate (less than 1 cm) hemorrhagic areas in the gastric mucosa. This is helpful in differentiating acute gastritis from peptic ulcers, which tend to be solitary and larger. Microscopically the gastric mucosa from a patient with acute gastritis is likely to reveal mucosal erosions, scattered neutrophils, edema, and possibly hemorrhage. Acute gastritis.

('Iliac crest involvement is common in which condition: March 2007', 'Ans. A: Ankylosing Spondylitis The basic pathologic lesion of ankylosing spondylitis occurs at the entheses, which are sites of attachment to bone of ligaments, tendons, and joint capsules. Enthesopathy results from inflammation, with subsequent calcification and ossification at and around the entheses. Inflammation with cellular infiltration by lymphocytes, plasma cells, and polymorphonuclear leukocytes is associated with erosion and eburnation of the subligamentous bone. The process usually stas at the sacroiliac joints. Other enthesopathic sites include the iliac crest, ischial tuberosity, greater trochanter, patella, and calcaneum. Ankylosing spondylitis/ AS/ Bechterew\'s disease/ Bechterew syndrome/ Marie Strumpell disease/Spondyloahritis is a chronic, painful, degenerative inflammatory ahritis primarily affecting spine and sacroiliac joints, causing eventual fusion of the spine. AS is a systemic rheumatic disease and one of the seronegative spondyloahropathies. About 90% of the patients express the HLA-B27 genotype. Men are affected more than women by a ratio in excess of 10:1. Typical signs of progressed AS are the visible formation of syndesmophytes on X-rays and abnormal bone outgrowths similar to osteophytes affecting the spine. Complete fusion results in a complete rigidity of the spine, a condition known as bamboo spine. In 40% of cases, ankylosing spondylitis is associated with iridocyclitis causing eye pain and photophobia. 4.1 AS is also associated with ulcerative colitis, Crohn\'s disease, psoriasis, and Reiter\'s disease Other complications are aoic regurgitation, Achilles tendinitis, AV node block and amyloidosis & restrictive lung disease.

('The number of ATPs generated in krebs cycleare ?', 'Ans. is \'b\' > b\' i.e., 24 One turn of the TCA cycle, staing with acetyl CoA produces 10 ATPs. When the staing molecule is pyruvate, the oxidative decarboxylation of pyruvate, the oxidative decarboxylation of pyruvate yields 2.5 ATPs and therefore, 12.5 ATPs are produced when staing compound is pyruvate. Since, two molecules of pyruvate enter the TCA cycle when glucose is metabolized (glycolysis produces 2 molecules of pyruvate), the number of ATPs is doubled. Therefore, 25 ATP molecules, per glucose molecule, are produced when pyruvate enters the TCA cycle.Note : Previously calculations were made assuming that NADH produces 3 ATPs and FADH generates 2 ATPs. This will amount a net generation of 30 ATP molecules in TCA per molecule glucose and total 38 molecules from staing. Recent experiments show that these values are overestimates and NADH produces 2.5 ATPs and FADH produces 1.5 ATPs. Therefore, net generation during TCA is 25 ATPs and complete oxidation of glucose through glycolysis plus citric acid cycle yield a net 32 ATPs.Energy yield (number of ATP generated) per molecule of glucose when it is completely oxidized through glycolysis plus citric acid cycle, under aerobic conditions, is as follows :- Method ofNo of ATPsNo of ATPsPathwayStepEnzymeSource ATP formationgained perglucose(new calculation)As per oldcalculationGlycolysis1Hexokinase MinusMinus 1Do3Phosphofructokinase MinusMinus 1Do5Glyceraldehyde-3-p DHNADH Respiratory chain2.5 x 2 = 53 x 2 = 6Do61,3-BPGkinase ATPSubstrate level1 x 2 -- 21 x 2 = 2Do9Pyruvate kinaseATP Substrate level1 x 2 = 21 x 2 = 2Pyruvate to?PyruvateNADH Respiratory chain2.5x2= 53x2= 6Acetyl CoA Dehydrogenase TCA cycle3Isocitrate DHNADH Respiratory chain2.5x2= 53 x 2= 6Do4Alpha keto glutarate DHNADH Respiratory chain2.5x2= 53x2= 6Do5Succinate thiokinaseGTP Substrate level1 x 2 = 21 x 2 = 2Do6Succicinate DHFADH2Respiratory chain1.5x2= 32 x 2= 4Do8Malate DHNADH Respiratory chain2.5x2= 53 x 2= 6Net generation in glycolytic pathway 9 minus 2= 7 10 minus 2= 8Generation in pyruvate dehydrogenase reaction 5 * 6Generation in citric acid cycle 20 * 24Net generation of ATP from one glucose mole 32 * 38', 2, '12', '24', '15', '30', 'Biochemistry', '', '2435c2fd-0ab9-4097-9969-6ce371e46532', 3, 2, '33.33', 16),

('Most serious complication seen in other eye after traumatic injury to one eye: March 2005, September 2008', 'Ans. C: Sympathetic ophthalmia Sympathetic ophthalmia (SO) is a condition in which serious inflammation attacks the sound eye after injury (including intraocular surgeries) to the other. It is the most dreaded complication of unilateral severe eye injury, as it can leave the patient completely blind. Symptoms may develop from days to several years after a penetrating eye injury. Sympathetic ophthalmia is thought to be an autoimmune inflammatory response toward ocular antigens, specifically a delayed hypersensitivity to melanin-containing structures from the outer segments of the photoreceptor layer of the retina. It is thought that Louis Braille, who injured his left eye as a child, lost vision in his right eye due to SO Floating spots and loss of accommodation are among the earliest symptoms. The disease may progress to severe iridocyclitis with pain and photophobia. Commonly the eye remains relatively painless while the inflammatory disease spreads through the uvea. The retina, however, usually remains uninvolved. Papilledema, secondary glaucoma, vitiligo and poliosis of the eyelashes may accompany SO. Diagnosis is clinical, seeking a history of eye injury. An impoant differential diagnosis is Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada syndrome (VKH), which is thought to have the same pathogenesis, without a history of surgery or penetrating eye injury. Definitive prevention of SO requires prompt (within the first 7 to 10 days following injury) enucleation of the injured eye. Evisceration--the removal of the contents of the globe while leaving the sclera and extraocular muscles intact--is easier to perform, offers long-term orbital stability, and is more aesthetically pleasing. But evisceration may lead to a higher incidence of SO compared to enucleation. Immunosuppressive therapy is the mainstay of treatment for SO. When initiated promptly following injury, it is effective in controlling the inflammation and improving the prognosis.', 3, 'Subconjunctival hemorrhage', 'Corneal edema', 'Sympathetic ophthalmia', 'Sudden loss of vision', 'Ophthalmology', '', 'c4dbe11c-2ef0-4043-adcb-5a068e9afe0e', 31, 23, '25.81', 42),

Additionally, a search for the underlying etiology of the hyponatremia should be undeaken.

('Enterobius commonly inhabit the: September 2011', 'Ans. D: Caecum Adult Enterobius vermicularis worms inhabit the caecum, appendix and adjacent poions of the ascending colon, lying closely applied to the mucosal surface. Pinworm (genus En terobius)/Threadworm/Seatworm, It is a nematode (roundworm) and a common human intestinal parasite, especially in children. It inhabits the caecum, appendix and adjacent poion of the ascending colon, lying closely applied to the mucosal surface It causes enterobiasis, or less precisely as oxyuriasis in reference to the family Oxyuridae. The pinworm appears as a white, small and delicate nematode. The adult female has a sharply pointed posterior end, is 8 to 13 millimeters long, and 0.5 millimeter thick. The adult male is considerably smaller, measuring 2 to 5 millimeters long and 0.2 millimeter thick, and has a curved posterior end. The eggs are translucent and have a surface that adheres to environmental objects. The eggs measure 50 to 60 micrometers by 20 to 30 micrometers, and have a thick shell that is flattened on one side. The small size and colorlessness of the eggs make them invisible to the naked eye, except in barely visible clumps of thousands of eggs. Eggs may contain a developing embryo or a fully developed pinworm larva.Inside the host, the larvae grow to 140-150 micrometers in length Pinworms spread through human-to-human transmission, by ingesting (i.e., swallowing) infectious pinworm eggs and/or by anal sex. The eggs are hardy and can remain ble (i.e., infectious) in a moist environment for up to three weeks.They do not tolerate heat well, but can survive in low temperatures: two-thirds of the eggs are still ble after 18 hours at -8 degrees Celsius (18 degF). After the eggs have been initially deposited near the anus, they are readily transmitted to other surfaces through contamination. The surface of the eggs is sticky when laid, and the eggs are readily transmitted from their initial deposit near the anus to fingernails, hands, night-clothing and bed linen.From here, eggs are fuher transmitted to food, water, furniture, toys, bathroom fixtures and other objects.Household pets often carry the eggs in their fur, while not actually being infected. Dust containing eggs can become airborne and widely dispersed when dislodged from surfaces, for instance when shaking out bed clothes and linen.Consequently the eggs can enter the mouth and nose through inhalation, and be swallowed later. Although pinworms do not strictly multiply inside the body of their human host, some of the pinworm larvae may hatch on the anal mucosa, and migrate up the bowel and back into the gastrointestinal tract of the original host. This process is called retroinfection. Despite the limited, 13 week lifespan of individual pinworms, autoinfection (i.e., infection from the original host to itself), either through the anus-to-mouth route or through retroinfection, causes the pinworms to inhabit the same host indefinitely', 4, 'Duodenum', 'Jejunum', 'Ileum', 'Caecum', 'Microbiology', '', 'f0f4d63e-5f4d-4994-bca1-ae5af65f0433', 89, 58, '34.83', 46),

Thyroglobulin is a large glycoprotein synthesized in the follicular cells and has a molecular weight of around 650 000 with about 140 tyrosine residues, depending on the form of thyroglobulin. Approximately one quaer of these residues is iodinated at the apical-colloid interface. Once iodinated, thyroglobulin is taken up into the colloid of the follicle where, still incorporated in the protein, a coupling reaction between pairs of iodinated tyrosine molecules occurs. The coupling of two tyrosine residues each iodinated at two positions (di-iodotyrosine, DIT) produces tetra-iodothyronine or thyroxine (T4 ) whilst the combination of DIT with mono-iodotyrosine (MIT) produces tri-iodothyronine (T3 ). Such coupling can occur within a single molecule of thyroglobulin or between dimerized molecules of the protein. This coupling is catalyzed by TPO. Thyroid hormones are stored in this state and are only released when the thyroglobulin molecule is taken back up into the follicular cells. Stimulated by TSH, thyroglobulin droplets are captured by the follicular cells by a process of pinocytosis. Fusion of the droplets with lysosomes results in hydrolysis of the thyroglobulin molecules and release of T3 and T4.

('MHC restriction is a pa of all except aEUR\'', 'Autoimmune disorder Major histocompatibility complex : Major histocompatibility complex, also called the human leucocyte antigen (HLA) complex is a 4 megahase region on chromosome 6. This region is densely packed with genes. These genes encodes two major proteins or antigens i.e., MHC I & MHC II. These proteins play an impoant role in the differentiation of foreign cells from host cell. Presence of these proteins is necessary for identification of host cells. Identification of the cells is impoant for immune responses. If the cell is recognised as self, the immune system will not mount an immune response against it. How does MHC helps in this ??? Cells continuously display small pieces of their own internal protein, carrying them, outsie the cell membrane where the immune system can see them. These peptides are just pieces of the normal proteins found inside the cell. These peptides are held together at the cell surface by major histocompatibility complex, which holds these peptides together for the immune system to examine them. Each persons immune system is customized early in life to ignore these peptides, so healthy cells are not able to trigger the immune system and they are left alone. But if any virus or other microorganism is multiplying inside the cell, the peptides synthesized by it also is displayed on the surface. The MHC displays these unusual (foreign) protein on the surface of the cell. The immune system is triggered because of these peptides, staing, a series of event that will eventually lead to killing of the cell containing foreign peptide. MHC is also the cause of tissue rejection during skin grafts and organ grafts. This is how the MHC protein got its name; the term histocompatibility refers to the difficulty of finding compatible grafts between a donor and a patient. Each person has their own collection of MHC molecules. If you graft a piece of skin that has a different collection of MHC types they will trigger the immune system to destroy the cell. So a compatible donor is needed such as a relative who has a similar collection of MHC molecules. MHC is also active against cancer Cancer cells, like normal cells, display pieces of their own protein on their surface. So if any of these proteins carries recognizable cancer mutations, this provides a signal to the immune system that something is wrong and the cell is killed. MHC plays role in activation of T helper cells (Th) MHC class II molecules are present on the membranes of dendritic cells, macrophages. These cell function as antigen presenting cell during immune response. They capture the antigen and present it to T helper cells. In response, the T helper cells secrete cytokines that stimulate B cell proliferation and antibody production. The impoant point about T helper cells is that they respond to only those antigens which have been presented to them by cells that have host matching MHC complex on the presenting cell. In general the antigen presenting cell .first phagocytoses the protein antigen and cleaves it to peptides in the lysosomes. These peptides are then extruded and attached to the presenting cell\'s surface MHC complex. T helper cells first, make sure, that these MHC class II molecules are host\'s own MHC and then responds appropriately. So, we can say that receptor on the T helper cell is thus responsive to the combination of antigen and host matching MHC complex on the presenting cell.

Patients with peritoneal signs should undergo emergent laparotomy. Acute mesenteric ischemia may be difficult to diagnose. The condition should be suspected in patients with either systemic manifestations of aeriosclerotic vascular disease or low cardiac-output states associated with a sudden development of abdominal pain that is out of propoion to the physical findings. Because of the risk of progression to small-bowel infarction, acute mesenteric ischemia is an emergency and timely diagnosis is essential. Although patients may have lactic acidosis or leukocytosis, these are late findings. Abdominal films are generally unhelpful and may show a nonspecific ileus pattern. Since the pathology involves the small bowel, a barium enema is not indicated. Upper gastrointestinal series and ultrasonography are also of limited value. CT scanning is a good initial test, but should still be followed by angiography in a patient with clinically suspected acute mesenteric ischemia, even in the absence of findings on the CT scan. In addition to establishing the diagnosis in this stable patient, angiography may also assist with operative planning and elucidation of the etiology of the acute mesenteric ischemia. The cause may be embolic occlusion or thrombosis of the superior mesenteric aery, primary mesenteric venous occlusion, or nonocclusive mesenteric ischemia secondary to low-cardiac output states. A moality of 50% to 75% is repoed. The majority of affected patients are at high operative risk, but early diagnosis followed by revascularization or resectional surgery or both are the only hope for survival. Celiotomy must be performed once the diagnosis of aerial occlusion or bowel infarction has been made. Initial treatment of nonocclusive mesenteric ischemia includes measures to increase cardiac output and blood pressure.

It is about 10% of total activity and is increased in obstructive jaundice and to some extent in metastatic carcinoma of liver.# Alpha-2 heat labile ALP is stable at 56degC; but loses its activity when kept at 65degC for 30 minutes. It is produced by hepatic cells. Therefore, exaggerated alpha-2 band suggests hepatitis. This liver iso-enzyme forms about 25% of total ALP.# Alpha-2 heat stable ALP will not be destroyed at 65degC, but is inhibited by phenylalanine. It is of placental origin, which is found in blood in normal pregnancy. An iso-enzyme closely resembling the placental form is characteristically seen in circulation in about 15% cases of carcinoma of lung, liver and gut and named as Regan iso-enzyme (after the first patient in whom it was detected) or carcinoplacental iso-enzyme. Chronic heavy smoking also increases Regan iso-enzyme level in blood. Normal level is only 1% of the total ALP.# Pre-beta ALP is of bone origin and elevated levels are seen in bone diseases. This is most heat labile (destroyed at 56degC, 10 min). Wheat germ lectin will precipitate bone isoenzyme. This constitutes about 50% of normal ALP activity.# Gamma-ALP is inhibited by phenylalanine and originates from intestinal cells. It is increased in ulcerative colitis. About 10% of plasma ALP are of intestinal variety.# Leucocyte alkaline phosphatase (LAP) is significantly decreased in chronic myeloid leukemia. It is increased in lymphomas and leukemoid reactions.ALANINE AMINO TRANSFERASE (ALT)# It is also called as serum glutamate pyruvate transaminase (SGPT).# The enzyme needs pyridoxal phosphate as co-enzyme.# Normal serum level of AL T for male is 13^4-0 U/L and for female is 10-28 U/L.# Very high values (100 to 1000 U/L) are seen in acute hepatitis, either toxic or viral in origin.# Both ALT and AST levels are increased in liver disease, but ALT > AST.# Moderate increase (25 to 100 U/L) may be seen in chronic liver diseases such as cirrhosis, Hepatoma.# A sudden fall in ALT level in cases of hepatitis is very bad prognostic sign.NUCLEOTIDE PHOSPHATASE# It is also known as 5\' nucleotidase.# It is a marker enzyme for plasma membranes and is seen as an ecto-enzyme (enzyme present on the cell membrane).# Serum samples contain both ALP and NTP.# These are distinguished by Nickel ions which inhibit NTP but not ALP.- Normal NTP level in serum is 2-10 IU/L.

('Treatment of Choice in Sleep Apnea Syndrome:', '(A) Continuous positive pressure ventilation# Sleep apnea: Sleep apnea is a sleep disorder characterized by pauses in breathing during sleep. Each episode, called an apnea, lasts long enough so that one or more breaths are missed, and such episodes occur repeatedly throughout sleep.> The standard definition of any apneic event includes a minimum 10 second interval between breaths, with either a neurological arousal (a 3-second or greater shift in EEG frequency, measured at C3, C4, O1, or O2), a blood oxygen desaturation of 3-4deg/: or greater, or both arousal and desaturation. Sleep apnea is diagnosed with an overnight sleep test called a polysomnogram, or a \"Sleep Study\".> Treatment: The most common treatment and arguably the most consistently effective treatment for sleep apnea is the use of a continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) device, which \'splints\' the patient\'s airway open during sleep by means of a flow of pressurized air into the throat. However the CPAP machine only assists inhaling whereas a BiPAP machine assists with both inhaling and exhaling, and is used in more severe cases.

('Ulipristal acetate is a/an:', 'Ans. is d, i.e. Selective progesterone receptor modulatorRef: Harrison\'s Principles of Internal medicine 19th/ed, p2391Ulipristal acetate (trade name Ella One in the European Union, Ella in the US for contraception, and Esmya for uterine fibroid) is a selective progesterone receptor modulator (SPRM).PharmacodynamicsAs an SPRM, ulipristal acetate has partial agonistic as well as antagonistic effects on the progesterone receptor. It also binds to the glucocorticoid receptor, but is only a weak anti-glucocorticoid relative to mifepristone, and has no relevant affinity to the estrogen, androgen and mineralocorticoid receptors. Phase II clinical trials suggest that the mechanism might consist of blocking or delaying ovulation and of delaying the maturation of the endometrium.Medical Uses* Emergency contraception: For emergency contraception, a 30mg tablet is used within 120 hours (5 days) after an unprotected intercourse or contraceptive failure. It has been shown to prevent about 60% of expected, pregnancies, and prevents more pregnancies than emergency contraception with levonorgestrel.* Treatment of uterine fibroids: Ulipristal acetate is used for preoperative treatment of moderate to severe symptoms of uterine fibroids in adult women of reproductive age in a daily dose of a 5mg tablet. Treatment of uterine fibroids with ulipristal acetate for 13 weeks effectively controlled excessive bleeding due to uterine fibroids and reduced the size of the fibroids.InteractionsUlipristal acetate is metabolized by CYP3A4 in vitro. Ulipristal acetate is likely to interact with substrates of CYP3A4, like rifampicin, phenytoin, St John\'s wort, carbamazepine or ritonavir. Therefore, concomitant use with these agents is not recommended. It might also interact with hormonal contraceptives and progestogens such as levonorgestrel and other substrates of the progesterone receptor, as well as with glucocorticoids.Adverse EffectsCommon side effects include abdominal pain and temporary menstrual irregularity or disruption. Headache and nausea were observed under long-term administration (12 weeks), but not after a single dose.ContraindicationsUlipristal acetate should not be taken by women with severe liver diseases because of its CYP-mediated metabolism. It has not been studied in women under the age of 18.Pregnancy: Unlike levonorgestrel, and like mifepristone, ulipristal acetate is embryotoxic in animal studies.

The patient should be tested for which of the following ?', 'Hepatitis C This is caused by an RNA flavivirus. Acute symptomatic infection with hepatitis C is rare. Most individuals are unaware of when they became infected and are identified only when they develop chronic liver disease. Eighty per cent of individuals exposed to the virus become chronically infected and late spontaneous viral clearance is rare. There is no active or passive protection against hepatitis C virus (HCV). Hepatitis C infection is usually identified in asymptomatic individuals screened because they have risk factors for infection, such as previous injecting drug use , or have incidentally been found to have abnormal liver blood tests. Although most people remain asymptomatic until progression to cirrhosis occurs, fatigue can complicate chronic infection and is unrelated to the degree of liver damage. Hepatitis C is the most common cause of what used to be known as \'non-A, non-B hepatitis\'. If hepatitis C infection is left untreated, progression from chronic hepatitis to cirrhosis occurs over 20-40 years. Risk factors for progression include male gender, immunosuppression (such as co-infection with HIV), prothrombotic states and heavy alcohol misuse. Not everyone with hepatitis C infection will necessarily develop cirrhosis but approximately 20% do so within 20 years. Once cirrhosis has developed, the 5- and 10-year survival rates are 95% and 81%, respectively. One-quaer of people with cirrhosis will develop complications within 10 years and, once complications such as ascites develop, the 5-year survival is around 50%. Once cirrhosis is present, 2-5% per year will develop primary hepatocellular carcinoma.

Bronchogenic carcinomas are associated with the development of many different types of paraneoplastic syndromes. These syndromes are usually associated with the secretion of ceain substances by the tumor cells. For example, ectopic secretion of ACTH may produce Cushing\'s syndrome, while ectopic secretion of antidiuretic hormone (syndrome of inappropriate ADH secretion) may produce hyponatremia. Hypocalcemia may result from the production of calcitonin, while hypercalcemia may result from the production of parathyroid hormone-related peptide (PTHrP), which is a normal substance produced locally by many different types of tissue. PTHrP is distinct from parathyroid hormone (PTH) patients with this type of paraneoplastic syndrome have increased calcium levels and decreased PTH levels. As a result of decreased PTH production, all of the parathyroid glands in these patients are atrophic. Other tumors associated with the production of PTHrP include clear cell carcinomas of the kidney, endometrial adenocarcinomas, and transitional carcinomas of the urinary bladder. Lung cancers are also associated with multiple, migratory venous thromboses. This migratory thrombophlebitis is called Trousseau\'s sign and is more classically associated with carcinoma of the pancreas. Hyperophic osteoahropathy is a syndrome consisting of periosteal new bone formation with or without digital clubbing and joint effusion. It is most commonly found in association with lung carcinoma, but it also occurs with other types of pulmonary disease. Erythrocytosis is associated with increased erythropoietin levels and some tumors, paicularly renal cell carcinomas, hepatocellular carcinomas, and cerebellar hemangioblastomas.

Ahritis (60-75%) Flitting and fleeting type of polyahritis involving large joints with no residual deformity is seen in 60-75% of patients and occurs early in rheumatic fever. Jaccod\'s ahritis: Ulnar detion of 4th and 5th finger with flexion at metacarpophalangeal joints is the only residual deformity seen in rheumatic polyahritis. Subcutaneous Nodules Non-tender nodules are seen over bony prominences like elbows, shin, occiput, spine in 3-5% of patients and occur 3-6 weeks after onset of rheumatic fever. Patients who have subcutaneous nodules almost always have carditis. Erythema Marginatum (< 5% and evanescent) Macular lesions with an erythematous rim and central clearing in a bathing suit distribution are seen in < 5% of patients and occur early in rheumatic fever. Chorea (Sydenham\'s Chorea) (2-30%) A neurological disorder with rapid, involuntary and purposeless non-repetitive movements with a self limiting course of 2-6 weeks is more common in females and is a late manifestation of rheumatic fever.

('Effective red cell diameter', 'Answer: (C) Thalassemia minor anemia may present with normal RBC diameter (265-68-Hrshmohon 7th) (630= Rabbins- basis disease)Red blood cell distribution width (RDW or RCDW) is a measure of the variation of red blood cell (RBC) volume that is reported as part of a standard complete blood count. Usually red blood cells are a standard size of about 6-8 pm in diameter. Certain disorders, however, cause a significant variation in cell size. Higher RDW values indicate greater variation in size. Normal reference range in human red blood cells is 11.5-14.5%. If anemia is observed, RDW test results are often used together with mean corpuscular volume (MCV) results to determine the possible causes of the anemia. It is mainly used to differentiate an anemia of mixed causes from an anemia of a single cause. Deficiencies of Vitamin Bl2 orfolate produce a macrocytic anemia (large cell anemia) in which the RDW is elevated in roughly two- thirds of all cases; however, a varied size distribution of red blood cells is a hallmark of iron deficiency anemia, and as such shows an increased RDW in virtually all cases. In the case of a mixed iron and B!2 deficiency, there will normally be a mix of both large cells and small cells, causing the RDW to be elevated. An elevated RDW (red blood cells of unequal sizes) is known as anisocytosis. An elevation in the RDW is not characteristic of all anemias; anemia of chronic disease,hereditary spherocytosis, acute blood loss, aplastic anemia (anemia resulting from an inability of the bone marrow to produce red blood cells), and certain hereditary hemoglobinopathies (including some cases of thalassemia minor) all may present with a normal RDW* The human erythrocyte is a biconcave disc, 7-2 pm in diameter, and has a thickness of 2-4 pm at the periphery and 1 mm in the centre* More than 90% of the weight of erythrocytes consists of haemoglobin.

('Signal from Baroreceptors goes to -', 'Ans. is C Nucleus of tractus solitarius o Baroreceptors are mechanoreceptors that are located in the adventia of carotid artery and aorta, at specialized locations called sinuses. Carotid sinus is a little bulge at the root of internal carotid artery, located just above the bifurcation of the common carotid artery. It is innerv ated by the sinus nerve, a branch of glossopharyngeal (IX cranial) nerve. Aortic arch (aortic sinus) also contains mechenoreceptors (stretch receptors) which are similar to carotid sinus receptors. However, their afferent nerve fibers travel in the aortic nerve, a branch of Vagus (X cranial) nerve. o The sinus nerve (from carotid sinus) and aortic nerve/vagal fibers (from aortic sinus) are together called \'Sino- aortic nerves\'. They, together, are also refered to as \'Buffer nerves\' because they are the afferents of cardiovascular reflexes that buffer abrupt changes in blood pressure. o Baroreceptors are highly sensitive to any change in mean blood pressure. Sinoaortic nerves (buffer nerves) normally discharge rhythmically, synchronous with the pressure fluctuation during systole and diastole. They respond to BP changes between 70 mm Hg and 150 mm Hg. When BP rises, baroreceptors are stimulated and their afferents (through sinoaortic nerves) stimulate nucleus of tractus solitarus (NTS) which inturn inhibits the pressor area of VMC, i.e., Rostral ventrolateral medula (RVLM). This results in decreased sympathetic outflow and therefore decreases in vasomotor tone and vasodilation. Vasodilation brings down the BP. Thereby helping hemostasis. Activated NTS also stimulates nucleus ambiguous (cardioinhibitory center) of medulla, which increases parasympathetic (vagal) output, through vagus, that decreases heart rate. Reduction in heart rate reduces the cardiac output, which also reduces BP. Baroreceptor stimulation also weekly inhibits respiration, o When BP falls, for instance while changing the posture from lying down to standing, reverse change takes place. When a person stands up, his blood is pooled in the veins of lowrer limbs by the effect of gravity. Central venous pressure and venous return decrease, which causes a fall in stroke volume. Hence the systolic BP falls. As a result, the discharge rate of baroreceptors decreases leading to a decrease in the inhibitory\' influence on the pressor area of VMC.

('Intrinsic factor of castle is secreted by which of the following cells in gastric glands', 'The stomach also adds a significant volume of digestive juices to the meal. Like salivary secretion, the stomach actually readies itself to receive the meal before it is actually taken in, during the so-called cephalic phase that can be influenced by food preferences. The gastric secretions arise from glands in the wall of the stomach that drain into its lumen, and also from the surface cells that secrete primarily mucus and bicarbonate to protect the stomach from digesting itself, as well as substances known as trefoil peptides that stabilize the mucus-bicarbonate layer. The glandular secretions of the stomach differ in different regions of the organ. The most characteristic secretions derive from the glands in the fundus or body of the stomach. These contain two distinctive cell types from which the gastric secretions arise: the parietal cells, which secrete hydrochloric acid and intrinsic factor; and the chief cells, which produce pepsinogens and gastric lipase. The acid secreted by parietal cells serves to sterilize the meal and also to begin the hydrolysis of dietary macromolecules. Intrinsic factor is impoant for the later absorption ofvitamin B12 or cobalamin. Pepsinogen is the precursor of pepsin, which initiates protein digestion. Lipase similarly begins the digestion of dietary fats.REF: GANONG&;S REVIEW OF MEDICAL PHYSIOLOGY, KIM BARRETT, HEDDWEN BROOKS, SCOTT BOITANO, SUSAN BARMANTWENTY THIRD EDITIONPAGE NO:432', 2, 'Chief cells', 'Parietal cells', 'Enterochromaffin cells', 'B cells', 'Physiology', 'G.I.T', '6a25c0d5-4d53-429a-ac5c-0bf0145cba6d', 62, 23, '62.90', 46),

Etomidate does not release histamine. Cardiovascular effect of Propofol:The major cardiovascular effect of propofol is a decrease in arterial blood pressure due to a drop in systemic vascular resistance (inhibition of sympathetic vasoconstrictor activity, cardiac contractility and preload).Propofol markedly impairs the normal arterial baroreflex response to hypotension. Sometimes there may be a marked drop in preload.Cardiovascular effect of barbiturates (Thiopental)The cardiovascular effect of barbiturates vary markedly depending on the volume status, bas line autonomic tone and preexisting cardiovascular disease.Normally, intravenously administered barbiturates cause a fall in blood pressure.Cardiac output is maintained due to increase in heart rate and increased myocardial contractility from compensatory baroreceptor reflexes.However, in the absence of adequate baroreceptor response (e.g., hypovolemia, congestive heart failure, b adrenergic blockade) cardiac output and arterial blood pressure may fall dramatically due to uncompensated pooling and unmasked direct myocardial depression.Effect of ketamine on cardiovascular systemKetamine causes central stimulation of sympathetic system which causes increased arterial blood pressure, heart rate and cardiac output. There is also increase in pulmonary artery pressure and myocardial work.Because of these effects, ketamine should be avoided in patients with coronary artery disease, uncontrolled hypertension, congestive heart failure and arterial aneurysms.', 2, 'Ketamine', 'Etomidate', 'Propofol', 'Midazolam', 'Anaesthesia', 'Anesthesia for Cardiovascular Disease and Surgery', '4f35d97f-70e7-40c9-befe-f9c759900efd', 36, 19, '47.22', 12),

('A patient present with lower gastrointestinal bleed. Sigmoidoscopy shows ulcers inthe sigmoid. Biopsy from this area shows flask-shaped ulcers. Which of the following is the most appropriate treatment -', 'This may be caused by haemorrhage from the colon, anal canal or small bowel. It is useful to distinguish those patients who present with profuse, acute bleeding from those who present with chronic or subacute bleeding of lesser severity .Severe acute lower gastrointestinal bleeding .This presents with profuse red or maroon diarrhoea and with shock. Diveicular disease is the most common cause and is often due to erosion of an aery within the mouth of a diveiculum. Bleeding almost always stops spontaneously, but if it does not, the diseased segment of colon should be resected after confirmation of the site by angiography or colonoscopy. Angiodysplasia is a disease of the elderly, in which vascular malformations develop in the proximal colon. Bleeding can be acute and profuse; it usually stops spontaneously but commonly recurs. Diagnosis is often difficult. Colonoscopy may reveal characteristic vascular spots and, in the acute phase, visceral angiography can show bleeding into the intestinal lumen and an abnormal large, draining vein. In some patients, diagnosis is achieved only by laparotomy with on-table colonoscopy. The treatment of choice is endoscopic thermal ablation but resection of the affected bowel may be required if bleeding continues. Bowel ischaemia due to occlusion of the inferior mesenteric aery can present with abdominal colic and rectal bleeding. It should be considered in patients (paicularly the elderly) who have evidence of generalised atherosclerosis. The diagnosis is made at colonoscopy. Resection is required only in the presence of peritonitis. Meckel\'s diveiculum with ectopic gastric epithelium may ulcerate and erode into a major aery. The diagnosis should be considered in children or adolescents who present with profuse or recurrent lower gastrointestinal bleeding. A Meckel\'s 99mTc-peechnetate scan is sometimes positive but the diagnosis is commonly made only by laparotomy, at which time the diveiculum is excised Primary prevention of variceal bleeding If non-bleeding varices are identified at endoscopy, b-adrenoceptor antagonist (b-blocker) therapy with propranolol (80-160 mg/day) or nadolol (40-240 mg/day) is effective in reducing poal venous pressure. Administration of these drugs at doses that reduce the hea rate by 25% has been shown to be effective in the primary prevention of variceal bleeding. In patients with cirrhosis, treatment with propranolol reduces variceal bleeding by 47% (number needed to treat for benefit (NNTB) 10), death from bleeding by 45% (NNTB 25) and overall moality by 22% (NNTB 16). The efficacy of b-blockers in primary prevention is similar to that of prophylactic banding, which may also be considered, paicularly in patients who are unable to tolerate or adhere to b-blocker therapy. Carvedilol, a non-cardioselective vasodilating b-blocker, is also effective and may be better tolerated at doses of 6.25-12.5 mg/day).

Symptoms of Bladder outlet obstruction and back pains (due to bony metastasis in the pelvis & lumbar veebra) indicate towards prostate Ca. Serum acid phosphates is a tumor marker of prostate Ca. But now serum acid phosphates assay has been superseded by PSA assay (Prostate specific antigen). Prostate-specific antigen It is a glycoprotein produced only in the prostatic cells (both benign & malignant). It facilitates liquefaction of semen. It is neither sensitive nor specific for early prostate carcinoma (it is prostate specific and not prostate cancer specific), neveheless it gives some help in making a diagnosis. Normal serum level - less than 4 mg/ml 4 - 10 mg/ml - this range is common for both BHP and Ca. More than 10 mg/ml - approx 75% will have cancer. Since PSA is not specific for Ca, PSA Velocity & PSA density is used to detect Prostate cancer. PSA velocity is the rate of change in PSA levels over time and is expressed most commonly as the PSA doubling time. For men with a PSA above 4, PSA velocity of more than .75 mg/ml year is suggestive of Ca. While for those with lower PSA levels, rates above 0.5 mg/ml, per year should be used to advise biopsy. PSA density is calculated by dividing the serum PSA by the estimated prostate weight (measured by TRUS). It was developed to correct for the contribution of BPH to the total PSA level.

This allow time for DNA repair.b) DNA repair: p-53 also helps in DNA repair directly by inducing transcription of GADD 45 (growth arrest and DNA damage). GADD 45 encodes a protein that is involved in DNA repair.* If DNA damage is repaired successfully, p53 activate MDM-3 and this MDM-3 induce degradation of p-53 - Relieve in cell cycle block. If DNA damage cannot be successfully repaired, p53 induces apoptosis by inducing the activation of apoptosis inducing gene BAX.

This b-dystroglycan, in turn connects to the merosin subunit of laminin 211 in the extracellular matrix a-dystroglycan The dytroglycans are also associated with a complex of four transmembrane glycoproteins, a-,b-,g- and d- sarcoglycan and sarcospan.

The gingival stimulation provided by a positioner is an excellent way to promote a rapid return to normal gingival contours.\n\nAs a general rule, a tooth positioner in a cooperative patient will produce any changes it is capable of within 2-3 weeks. Final (post-treatment) records and retainer impressions can be taken 2 or 3 weeks after the positioner is placed. Beyond that time, if the positioner is continued, it is serving as a retainer rather than a finishing device-and positioners, as a rule, are not good retainers.\nContemporary orthodontics- proffit 4th edition page 614', 4, 'Final setting of occlusion', 'Used in uncooperative patients', 'Esthetics', 'Gingival margin inflamed during orthodontic treatment', 'Dental', '', 'dd9154c8-18f3-40ee-9309-5be6f26e6818', 69, 30, '56.52', 25),

Volume cycled assist control mode of ventilation is the most commonly used mode of ventilation. Volume targeted modes deliver a preset volume unless a specified circuit pressure limit is exceeded. Its major advantages are capacity to deliver unvarying tidal volumes, flexibility of flow and volume adjustments, and power to ventilate difficult patients. Disadvantages of this type of ventilation are: Unless the airway is well sealed volume cycled modes cannot ventilate effectively and consistently.

Xerophthalmia caused by a severe vitamin A deficiency is described by pathologic dryness of the conjunctiva and * cornea. The conjunctiva becomes dry, thick and wrinkled. If untreated, it can lead to corneal ulceration and ultimately to blindness as a result of corneal damage. Xerophthalmia is a term that usually implies a destructive dryness of the conjunctival epithelium due to dietary vitamin A deficiency -- a rare condition in developed countries, but still causing much damage in developing countries. Other forms of dry eye are associated with aging, poor lid closure, scarring from previous injury, or autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid ahritis and SjOgren\'s syndrome, and these can all cause chronic conjunctivitis. Radioiodine therapy can also induce xerophthalmia, often transiently Xerophthalmia from hypovitaminosis A is specifically due to lack of the hormone-like vitamin A metabolite retinoic acid Treatment can occur in two ways: treating symptoms and treating the deficiency. Treatment of symptoms usually includes use of aificial tears in the form of eye drops, increasing the humidity of the environment with humidifiers, and wearing wrap around glasses when outdoors. Treatment of the deficiency can be accomplished with a Vitamin A or multivitamin supplement or by eating foods rich in Vitamin A.

('Which is NOT used in treatment of heroin dependence?', 'Ans. is \'a\' i.e., Disulfiram o Heroin is diamorphine and is 3 times more potent than morphine.Treatment of morphine or heroin poisoningo Treatment can be divided into:-A. Treatment of toxicity (overdose)# Overdose is a medical emergency, and is treated with opioid antagonist to reverse the complications (respiratory depression) by antagonizing the action on opioid receptors. Intravenous naloxone is the antagonist of choince for morphine (heroin) poisoning. Oral naltrexone is used for maintenance therapy, once acute poisoning has been treated by iv naloxone. Intravenous nalmefene is another specific antagonist.B. Treatment of dependence# Treatment of dependence include medically supervised withdrawal and detoxification, followed by maintenance therapy.a) Detoxificationo Detoxification process include abrupt withdrawal of opioid followed by management of the emergent withdrawal symptoms, i.e., treatment of withdrawal syndrome. Detoxification can be done by any of the following.1. Substitution of long-acting opioid agonism:- Methadone is the treatment of choice. Because of its agonistic activity on opioid receptors it suppresses withdrawal symptoms. L-alpha-acetyl-methadol/ Levomethyl (LAAM) is the other opioid agonist which was used for this purpose. However it is no longer in use because some patients developed prolonged QT intervals (torsades de points).2. Substitution of partial agonist:- Buprenorphine can be used in place of methadone because of its partial agonistic activity on opioid receptor.3. Substitution by a2 agonists:- Clonidine acts as a sympatholytic agent due to its agonistic action on central presynaptic a2 receptors which reduce nor-adrenergic activity. Therefore, clonidine reduces the adrenergic withdrawal symptoms. Lofexidine another a2 agonist, is an alternative to clonidine.4. Clonidine plus naltrexone:- A more rapid detoxification can occur when clonidine is used along with naltrexone. Naltrexone, when given in opioid dependent patient, causes withdrawal symptoms because of its antagonistic action. These can be treated with clonidine. The addition of short acting Benzodiazepine (lorazepam or oxazepam) and NSAIDs, will help relieve withdrawl symptoms not covered by clonidine. It should be kept in mind that naltrexone should not be used alone for detoxification (to treat withdrawl syptoms) as it precipitates or worsens the withdrawl syndrome.5. Other drugs:- Dextropropoxyphene, diphenoxylateb) M aintenance therapyo Once detoxification phase is over (i.e., withdrawal symptoms have been managed), the patient is maintained on any of the following drugs to prevent relapse by reducing craving and preventing \'kick\' or \'euphoria\' produced by opioids (morphine or heroin). Drugs used are:-1. Methadone:- Reduces craving and \'kick/euphoria\' from morphine or heroin because their opioid receptors are already occupied.2. LAAM and buprenorphine:- Similarly reduce craving.3. Opioid antagonists (naltrexone):- Naltrexone can be used orally to assist in the rehabilitation of exopioid abusers who are fully withdrawn (otherwise it induces an acute withdrawl syndrome). Naltrexone prevents relapse by discouraging substance seeking behavior - If a patient, who is on naltrexone maintenance therapy, takes an opioid, there is no \'kick\' or \'euphoria\' as opioid receptors are already blocked. Naltrexone can be used with clonidine as in detoxification.', 1, 'Disulfiram', 'Buprenorphine', 'Clonidine', 'Lofexidine', 'Social & Preventive Medicine', 'Mental Health', 'c993142b-7bc3-473a-8327-c9eee155c943', 45, 36, '20.00', 22),

('Not true about post-transcriptional modification of RNA-', 'Ans. is \'d\' i.e., Glycosyiution.m-RNA processingo Prokaryotic mRNA is functional immediately upon synthesis, i.e. prokaryotic primary transcript of mRNA is functional. Thus it does not require post-transcriptional modification. In Eukaryotes the primary transcript of mRNA is the hn RNA (hetrogeneous nuclear RNA). After transcription hnRNA is extensively modified to form functional mRNA. These modifications are as follows.The 51-cappingThis is the first processing reaction. 5l-end of mRNA is capped with 7-methylguansosine. This cap helps in initiation of translation (protein synthesis) and stabilizes the structure of mRNA by protecting from 5\'-exonuclease.Addition of poly \'A\' tail As the name suggests, multiple4A\' (adenylate) residues are added at 31 end.This poly-A tail is not transcribed from DNA. but rather added after transcription. These tails helps to stabilize the mRNA (by protecting from 31-exonuclease), facilitate exit from the nucleus, and aid in translation. After mRNA enters the cytosol, the poly-A tail is gradually shortened. Some mRNAs do not have poly-A tail, e.g. mRNAs of histones and some interferons.Removal of introns (splicing) Eukaryotic genes contain some coding sequences which code for protein and some intervening non-coding sequences which do not code for protein. The coding sequences are called \'exons\'and intervening non-coding sequences are called \'introns\'. The process by which introns are excised and exons are linked to form functional mRNA is called splicing. Thus mature mRNA does not contain introns.# Spitcesome :- Splicesome is an assembly made up of small nuclear RNA (snRNA), some proteins and hnRNA. snRNA combines with proteins to form small nuclear ribnonucleoprotein particles (snRNPs or snurps) that mediate splicing. It is snRNA component of snurps that catalyzes splicing. Snurps are U1, U2, U3, U4, U5 and U6-o Only about 1[?]5% of human DNA has coding sequence (exons). Remaining is non-coding (introns).Alternate splicing :- The hn-RNA molecules from some genes can be spliced in alternative way in different tissues. Thus two or more different mRNA (and therefore 2 or more proteins) can be synthesized from same hnRNA. For example, difference isoforms of tropomyosin in different tissues in due to alternate splicing.', 4, '5\' Capping', 'Addition of poly A tail', 'Removal of introns', 'Glycosylation', 'Biochemistry', 'Transcription', '4a7e4a82-c921-46b8-b8e5-9d903fc7b76e', 52, 43, '17.31', 47),

('Regarding glutathione which of the following is/are true:', 'Ans:C.)It helps in membrane transpo. GLUTATHIONE: Glutathione is a tripeptide made up of glutamate, cysteine and glycine (T-glutamyl-cysteinyl-glycine). Glutathione is present in all mammalian cells except neurons. The sulphydryl (-SH) group of cysteine residue is the reactive poion of glutathione which can undergo oxidation and reduction. Thus, glutathione may exist as the reduced (G-SH) or oxidized form (G-S-S-G) and can play a role in some oxidation-reduction reactions. In oxidized form two molecules of glutathione are linked by disulfide bond. Cysteine in glutathione act as reducing agent FUNCTIONS : - It helps in keeping some enzyme in active state by preventing the oxidation of sulphydryl (-SH) group of enzyme. It helps in detoxification of H2O2 by reducing it. Superoxide anion (O2) first conveed to H2O2 by superoxide dismutase. Glutathione helps in membrane transpo H2O2 is then reduced to H2O2 by glutathione perioxidase, a reaction requires reduced glutathione. Thus, glutathione scavenges free radicals and superoxide anion. It helps in detoxification of xenobiotics by their conjugation (conjugation reaction). Reduced form of glutathione (GSH) with a free sulphydryl (-SH) group serves as a redox buffer, regulating redox state of the cell. Reduced glutathione is essential for maintaining the normal structure of RBCs and for keeping hemoglobin iron in ferrous state (prevents formation of methemoglobin). It is involved in the transpo of amino acids across the cell membane of kidney and intestine.', 3, 'It helps in absorption of ceain amino acids', 'It inactivates some enzymes', 'It helps in membrane transpo', 'All', 'Biochemistry', '', '34d3fb84-0234-40aa-ac97-7263a8cb1329', 42, 17, '59.52', 13),

Like retinopathy, neuropathy occurs secondary to metabolic disturbance, and prevalence is related to the duration of diabetes and the degree of metabolic control. Pathological features can occur in any peripheral nerves.

It is also observed that activity of renal glutaminase is enhanced in acidosis. The NH3 mechanism is a valuable device for the conservation of fixed base. Under normal conditions, 30 to 50 mEq of H+ ions are eliminated per day, by combination with NH3 and about 10 to 30 mEq, as titratable acid, i.e. buffered with PO4. Ammonia Mechanism A third mechanism operates in the distal renal tubule cells, for the elimination of H+ ions and the conservation of Na+, by production of NH3 by the renal tubular epithelial cells. Source of NH3 in Distal Tubular Epithelial Cells 1. NH3 is produced by the hydrolysis of Glutamine by the enzyme Glutaminase which is present in these cells. 2. In addition to above, if the cells require NH3 more *NH3 can also be formed from other amino acids by oxidative deamination by L-amino acid oxidase. *NH3 can also be formed from glycine by glycineoxidase. The NH3 thus formed forms NH+4 ions by combining with H+ ions and NH+4 ions can exchange Na+ ion from NaCl. NH+4 ions formation *NH3 can diffuse into the tubular filtrate and there forms NH+4 ions in combination with H+ ions. *NH3 can combine with H+ ions inside the cells and then NH+4 ions come into tubular filtrate.

The diseased liver cannot produce adequate amounts of albumin, which leads to a decrease in the concentration of albumin in the plasma, i.e., hypoalbuminemia. Because about 75% of the plasma colloid osmotic pressure can be attributed to the presence of albumin in the plasma, the decrease in plasma albumin concentration that occurs in the latter stages of cirrhosis often leads to peripheral edema. Cirrhosis also causes excess fluid to accumulate in the peritoneal cavity as ascites. In the case of ascites, the edema results not only from hypoalbuminemia, but also from poal vein obstruction (which increases capillary hydrostatic pressure) as well as the obstruction of lymphatic drainage of the liver. In fact, ascites is observed more often than peripheral edema in liver disease. A decrease in capillary hydrostatic pressure would tend to decrease fluid loss from the capillaries, and thereby oppose the development of edema. A decrease in the colloid osmotic pressure of the interstitial fluid would decrease fluid loss from the capillaries, thereby opposing the development of edema. A decrease in interstitial hydrostatic pressure would tend to increase fluid loss from the capillaries, but this cannot be considered a primary cause of edema because the interstitial hydrostatic pressure actually increases when a tissue becomes edematous.

('All of the following are true about OPSI (Overwhelming Postsplenectomy Infection), Except:', 'Ans is A (Maximum risk is within 1 year of splenectomy) Overwhelming Postsplenectomy Infection (OPSI) Splenectomised patients are likely to suffer from severe infections. This syndrome is called overwhelming postsplenectomy infection (OPSI). OPSI is among the more devastating sequelae of asplenia and is the most common fatal late complication of splenectomy. The loss of the spleen\'s ability to filter and phagocytose bacteria and parasitized blood cells predisposes the patient to infection by encapsulated bacteria or parasites. Splenectomy also results in the loss of a significant source of antibody production. Infection may occur at any time after splenectomy; in one recent series, most infections occurred more than 2 years after splenectomy, and 42% occurred more than 5 years after splenectomy.\"- Sabiston I8/e The risk for OPSI is greater after splenectomy for malignancy or hematologic disease than for trauma. The risk also appears to be greater in young children (<4 years of age). OPSI may begin with a relatively mild-appearing prodrome, including fever, malaise, myalgias, headache, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain. These symptoms may then progress rapidly to fulminant bacteremic septic shock, with accompanying hypotension, anuria, disseminated intravascular coagulation, coma, and death within hours of presentation. The moality rate is between 50% and 70% for fully developed OPSI despite antibiotics and intensive care. Survivors often have a long and complicated hospital course with severe sequelae, such as peripheral gangrene requiring amputation, deafness from meningitis, mastoid osteomyelitis, bacterial endocarditis, and cardiac valvular destruction. S. pneumoniae is the most frequently involved organism in OPSI and is estimated to be responsible for between 50% and 90% of cases. Other organisms involved in OPSI include Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria meningitidis, Streptococcus species and other pneumococcal species, Salmonella species, and Capnocytophaga canimorsus (implicated in OPSI as a sequela of dog bites). Currently, the standard of care for postsplenectomy patients includes immunization within 2 weeks of splenectomy with: - polyvalent pneumococcal vaccine (PPV23), - H. influenzae type b conjugate, and - meningococcal polysaccharide vaccine Antibiotic prophylaxis--usually a single daily dose of penicillin or amoxicillin--is recommended for asplenic children.

It also secretes the hydatid fluid which fills the cavity. The fluid is clear, colourless / pale yellow with a pH of 6.7 containing salts and protein. It is a good antigen which sensitises the host. The fluid was used as the antigen for Casoni\'s intradermal test and other diagnostic serological tests. From the germinal layer, small knob like excrescences / gemmules protrude into the lumen of the cyst. These enlarge and become vacuolated and filled with fluid. These are called brood capsules. They are initially attached to the germinal layer by a stalk, but later escapes free into the fluid filled cyst cavity. From the inner wall of brood capsule, protoscolices develop, which represent head of adult worm, complete with invaginated scolex, bearing suckers and hooklets. Each of these are potential tapeworm. Many of the scolices float free in the cyst fluid. These with free brood capsules are called hydatid sand.

Supplemental oxygen administration which was for a long time considered as the important causative factor is now considered only a risk factor. \" - Khuran Ophthalmology 4/e p264 \"ROP is confined to those with a birth weight of under 1.5 kg and/or a gestational age of under 32 wks. \"- Parson 21/e P310 The hallmark of retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) is abnormal retinal vasculature. Ophthalmologists diagnose and make decisions about the initial treatment of ROP based on the appearance of the retinal blood vessels. Dilatation and tortuosity of the retinal vessels at the posterior pole is termed \'plus\' disease. It is a sign of rapidly progressive ROP and is an indication for early laser ablation of the peripheral avascular retina.Retinopathy of prematurity (ROP)ROP is a bilateral proliferative retinopathy that develops in premature infants due to incomplete vasculogenesis of retina at the time of birth.During normal retinal development, vessels migrate from the optic disc to the ora serrata beginning at 16weeks of gestation. Capillary network is formed differentiating into mature vessels which extend to nasal ora by 36 wks and tangential ora by 39-41 wks.The pathogenesis of ROP begins with premature birth. Exposure of extrauterine environment causes phases of hyperoxia-vasocessation (obliteration of retinal vessels) and hypoxia-Vaso proliferation (neovascularization). VEGF is thought to be the most important molecule involved in the neovascularization.Neovascularization leads to retinal and vitreous changes which ultimately lead to retinal detachment.Classification of ROP:ROP is described using a number of parameters. These are location of the disease into zones (1, 2, and 3), the circumferential extent of the disease based on the clock hours (1-12), the severity of the disease (stage 1-5) and the presence or absence of \"Plus Disease\".Classification on the basis of severity, ROP is divided into 5 stages:-Stage I- the first sign of ROP (stage 1) is the appearance of a thin, fiat, white structure (termed a demarcation line) at the junction of vascularized retina posteriorly and avascular retina anteriorly.Stage II- the demarcation line develops into a pink or white elevation (ridge) of thickened tissueStage III- proliferation of vessels over the ridge and into vitreous (extra vitreal fibrovascular proliferation)Stage IV- partial retinal detachmentIVa- partial detachment with macular sparing IVb- partial detachment with macula involvedStage V- total retinal detachmentClassification on basis of anatomical location:-Since there is a direct correlation between severity of disease and amount of avascular retina, the location of the border between vascularized and avascular retina is an important prognostic sign.3 zones are divided to describe the location of ROP. Location of the border in zone 1 is the most severe disease and in zone 3 least.Zone 1 is defined as a circle, the center of which is the disc, and the radius of which is twice the distance of the disc to the fovea.Zone 2 is a doughnut-shaped region that extends from the anterior border of Zone 1 to within one disc-diameter of the ora serrata nasally and to the anatomic equator temporally.Zone 3 encompasses the residual temporal retina.Plus disease:- As ROP progresses, more and more shunting occurs in the neovascular tissue at the retinal vascular- avascular junction. This increased retinal vascular blood flow results in dilation and tortuosity of the major retinal arteries and veins in the posterior pole - described as \"plus disease\". Plus disease is the hallmark of rapidly progressive ROP and is notated by adding a plus sign after the number of the ROP stage.Management:Most of the cases (approx. 80%) of ROP resolve spontaneously, hence intervention is chosen according to the below given protocol.ROP is divided into Threshold and Pre threshold disease.Threshold disease: It is defined as stage 3+ ROP in Zones 1 or 2 occupying at least five contiguous clock-hours or eight noncontiguous clock-hours of retina.Treatment of Threshold disease is - Laser photocoagulation.Pre threshold disease is divided into 2 types:High risk or Type I - treatment is Laser photocoagulationLow risk or Type II - treatment is Weekly or Twice weekly observationType 1 Pre thresholdType 2 Pre thresholdZone I ROP (any stage) + Zone I, Stage 3 Zone II, Stage 2/3 +Zone I, Stage 1/2 - Zone II, Stage 3 -Laser PhotocoagulationWeekly or Twice weekly observationROP diseases less severe than Pre threshold are followed up.In this question, the child with zone 1, stage II \'plus\' ROP falls into Pre threshold disease- Type 1 or high risk type, hence Laser Photocoagulation would be the management of choice.', 1, 'laser photocoagulation', 'slow reduction in oxygen', 'retinal reattachment', 'antioxidants', 'Ophthalmology', 'Dystrophies and Degenerations', '6ced785b-413c-4df8-8ce8-aa579c6d9521', 25, 16, '36.00', 50),

('Increased osmotic fragility is characteristic of:September 2009', 'Ans. A: Hereditary spherocytosisThe normal red blood cell is a relatively impermeable biconcave disc which maintains osmotic equilibrium with the surrounding medium. As the surrounding medium becomes hypotonic, fluid will be taken into the cell to maintain stability. Eventually under very hypotonic conditions the cell will fill to capacity and rupture. Spherocytic red blood cells have a decreased capacity to expand, and will rupture in mildly hypotonic conditions that fail to lyse normal red cells. They thus exhibit increased osmotic fragility.Osmotic fragility is determined by measuring the degree of hemolysis in hypotonic saline solution. With the unincubated test, red cell osmotic fragility is considered to be increased if hemolysis occurs in a sodium chloride concentration > 0.5%. Although increased osmotic fragility is characteristically associated with hereditary spherocytosis, it may also be increased in other types of hemolytic anemia associated with the presence of spherocytes, paicularly auto-immune hemolytic anemia, and in hypernatermia (Na > 155 meq/L).Often the increased osmotic fragility in spherocytosis is limited to a small fraction of cells that are unusually susceptible to lysis. After incubation, the defect is magnified, and a striking increase in fragility will be seen in hereditary spherocytosis. Osmotic fragility is considered to be decreased if hemolysis is not complete in a 0.30% NaC1 solution. Decreased osmotic fragility is associated with chronic liver disease, iron deficiency anemia, thalassemia, hyponatremia (Na < 130 meq/ L), polycythemia vera, and sickle cell anemia after splenectomy.', 1, 'Hereditary spherocytosis', 'Sickle cell anemia', 'Thalassemia', 'Iron deficiency anemia', 'Pathology', '', '9f78aa57-fa01-4142-8b6b-0c29dd2d57ba', 45, 14, '68.89', 16),

Activated neutrophils are sequestered into the lungs and capillary permeability is increased, with damage to cells within the alveoli. The pathophysiology is part of the inﬂammatory spectrum, and the triggers are similar: infective and non-infective inﬂammatory processes. These processes result in exudation and accumulation of protein-rich cellular ﬂuid within alveoli and the formation of characteristic ‘hyaline membranes’. Local release of cytokines and chemokines by activated macrophages and neutrophils results in progressive recruitment of inﬂammatory cells. Secondary effects include loss of surfactant and impaired surfactant production. The net effect is alveolar collapse and reduced lung compliance, most marked in dependent regions of the lung (mainly dorsal in supine patients). \nThe affected airspaces become ﬂuid-ﬁlled and can no longer contribute to ventilation, resulting in hypoxaemia (due to increased pulmonary shunt) and hypercapnia (due to inadequate ventilation in some areas of the lung): that is, ventilation–perfusion mismatch.\nReference: : Davidson P R I N C I P L E S   and Practice O F M E D I C I N E 23rd edition page no  198', 1, 'Dilated bronchioles', 'Edema', 'Fibrosis', 'Alveolar damage', 'Medicine', '', 'd15f2c4a-692f-4748-9828-37f062ef7ea7', 77, 53, '31.17', 39),

Malignant otitis externa (also k/a Necrotizing external otitis) Malignant otitis externa is an inflammatory condition of the external ear usually spreading deep to cause osteomyelitis of temporal bone and base of skull. It occurs primarily in immunocompromised persons, especially older persons with diabetes mellitus, and is often initiated by self-inflicted or iatrogenic trauma to the external auditory canal [May also be seen in pts. who received radiotherapy to skull base I The most frequent pathogen is Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Others may be S. aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Aspergillus, Actinomyces, and some gram-negative bacterial. One of the hallmarkof malignant otitis externs is granulation tissue in the external auditory canal, especially at the hone-cailage junction. As the infection spreads to the temporal bone, it may extend into the cranium and result in cranial nerve palsies (commonly the facial nerve) Cranial nerve involvement indicates poor prognosis. Death is usually due to intracranial complications such as sigmoid sinus thrombosis. It has high moality rate due to which the name \'malignant\' is used for this disease. Treatment Includes correction of immunosuppression (when possible), local treatment of the auditory canal, long-term systemic antibiotic therapy, and in selected patients, surgery. - In all cases, the external ear canal is cleansed and a biopsy specimen of the granulation tissue sent for culture. - IV antibiotics is directed against the offending organism. - For Pseudomonas aeruginosa, the most common pathogen, the regimen involves an antipseudomonal penicillin or cephalosporin (3rd generation-piperacillin or ceftazidime) with an aminoglycoside. A fluoroquinolone antibiotic can be used in place of the aminoglycoside.

These guidelines clearly state that if the patient cannot cope with the procedure, one should attempt other strategies to handle the situation. The guidelines all acknowledge that, in some cases, radiographs are not possible, in which case, one should balance the benefit against the risk even more carefully. Sometimes it is better to postpone the radiographic exposure until the patient is older or better conditioned. The guidelines also clearly state that if there are no clinical signs of pathology, the need for a radiographic assessment is up to the professional’s judgment, and that these decisions have to be made on an individual patient basis. Radiographs are never to be used for economic and screening reasons since they involve a potential health risk for the patient.

('What is irregular astigmatism-', 'Ans. is \'b\' i.e., Non perpendicular principal meridians ASTIGMATISMo Astigmatism is a type of refractive error wherein the refraction varies in the different meridia. Consequently, the rays of light entering in the eye cannot converge to a point focus but form focal lines. The refractive error of the astigmatic eye stems from a difference in degree of curvature refraction of the two different meridians (i.e.,, the eye has different focal point in different planes). For example, the image may be clearly focused on retina in the horizontal plane, but not in the vertical plane.o The most common cause of astigmatism is abnormality of corneal curvature. Other less common causes are lenticular (curvature abnormality of lens,oblique position of lens) and retinal (oblique placement of macula). Types of astigmatismBased on axis of the principal meridiansRegular stigmatism : Principal meridians are perpendicularo With-the-rule astigmatism-the vertical meridian is steepest.o Against-the-rule astigmatism-the horizontal meridian is steepest.o Oblique astigmatism-the steepest curve lies in between 120 and 150 degrees and 30 and 60 degrees.Irregular astigmatism - principal meridians are not perpendicular.Based on focus of the principal meridiansSimple astigmatismo Simple hyperopic astigmatism - first focal line is on retina while the second is located behind the retinao Simple myopic astigmatism - first focal line is in front of the retina while the second is on the retina.Compound astigmatismo Compound hyperopic astigmatism-both focal lines are located behind the retina,o Compound myopic astigmatism-both focal lines are located in front of the retina.Mixed astigmatism-focal lines are on both sides of the retina (straddling the retina).Treatment of Astigmatismo Treatment of astigmatism consists : -Optical treatment: - It consists of cylindrical power spectacles or contact lens.

The relative youthfulness of the patient often rules out prostatic enlargement, which characteristically occurs after the age of 50. As the stream becomes narrower, micturition is prolonged and is followed by postmicturition dribbling as a result of urine trickling from the dilated urethra proximal to the stricture. Urinary frequency by day and night is common and is due to incomplete bladder emptying, coexisting detrusor overactivity or urinary infection. If the stricture is tight enough, the patient will go into acute retention, although this is rare. If this happens, there is a danger that clumsy attempts to pass a urethral catheter will result in a false passage. If a patient has gone into retention because of a urethral stricture, its lumen will be too narrow to pass even a tiny catheter and suprapubic catheterisation is required. Investigation involves uroflowmetry, urethroscopy, urethrography and ultrasound scanning to assess bladder emptying and to detect any upper tract dilatation. The urinary flow rate is typically prolonged and plateau shaped while urethroscopy allows the stricture to be viewedas a circumferential scar. Openings of false passages commemorate previous misguided attempts to pass a urethral catheter.

Posterior urethral valve These are symmetrical folds of urothelium extending distally from prostatic urethra to external urinary sphincter. It most commonly lies just distal to the verumontanum or at the verumontanum* It occurs only in males. It behaves as flap valves so, although urine does not flow normally a urethral catheter can be passed without difficulty. Sometimes, the valves are incomplete and the patient remains without symptoms until adolescence or adulthood. Approximately 30% of patients experience end stage renal disease Vesicoureteral reflux occurs in 50% of patients. Diagnosis is made by (a) voiding cystourethrogram* & (b) endoscopy Both of these investigations clearly depict the site of obstruction. The diagnosis can be established prenatally by ultrasound.* Management First a small polyethylene feeding tube is inseed in the bladder and left for several days.

Prolonged sedation (>24 h at 0.1-0.6% isoflurane) of critically ill patients has resulted in elevated plasma fluoride levels (15-50 mmol/L) without evidence of kidney impairment. Similarly, up to 20 MAC-hours of isoflurane may lead to fluoride levels exceeding 50 mmol/L without detectable postoperative kidney dysfunction. Its limited oxidative metabolism also minimizes any possible risk of significant hepatic dysfunction. Total hepatic blood flow (hepatic aery and poal vein flow) may be reduced during isoflurane anesthesia. Hepatic oxygen supply is better-maintained with isoflurane than with halothane, however, because hepatic aery perfusion is preserved. Liver function tests are usually not affected. The major effect of acute inhalation of chloroform is central nervous system depression. At concentrations from 1,500-30,000 ppm, chloroform exposure can induce anesthesia; at concentrations exceeding 40,000 ppm, it can be fatal. Chronic inhalation of chloroform in humans results in hepatotoxicity and central nervous symptoms such as depression and irritability.

The test is based on the fact that erythrocytes with a large propoion of hemoglobin S sickle in solutions of low oxygen content. Metabisulfite is a reducing substance that enhances the process of deoxygenation. The osmotic fragility test is a diagnostic test for hereditary spherocytosis. Spherocytes lyse at a higher concentration of salt than do normal cells, thus causing an increased osmotic fragility. The direct antiglobulin test (DAT), or Coombs\' test, is used to differentiate autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA) due to the presence of anti-red cell antibodies from other forms of hemolytic anemia. In this test, antibodies to human immunoglobulin cause the agglutination (clotting) of red cells if these anti-red cell antibodies are present on the surface of the red cells. In patients with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria, the erythrocytes are excessively sensitive to complement-mediated lysis in low ionic environments (the basis for the sucrose hemolysis test) or in acidotic conditions, such as sleep, exercise, or the Ham\'s acid hemolysis test. The Schilling test, which measures intestinal absorption of vitamin B12 with and without intrinsic factor, is used to diagnose decreased vitamin B12 caused by pernicious anemia, which is characterized by a lack of intrinsic factor.

('Hypocalcemia with hyperphosphatemia are seen in.', '<p>Improved medical management of chronic kidney disease now allows many patients to survive for decades and hence time enough to develop features of renal osteodystrophy, which must be controlled to avoid additional morbidity. Impaired production of 1,25(OH) 2 D is now thought to be the principal factor that causes calcium deficiency, secondary hyperparathyroidism, and bone disease; hyperphosphatemia typically occurs only in the later stages of CKD. Low levels of 1,25(OH) 2 D due to increased FGF23 production in bone are critical in the development of hypocalcemia. The uremic state also causes impairment of intestinal absorption by mechanisms other than defects in vitamin D metabolism. Nonetheless, treatment with supraphysiologic amounts of vitamin D or calcitriol corrects the impaired calcium absorption. Since increased FGF23 levels are seen even in early stages of renal failure in some patients, and have been repoed to correlate with increased moality, there is current interest in methods (lowering phosphate absorption) to lower FGF23 levels and concern as to whether vitamin D supplementation (known physiologically to increase FGF23) increases FGF23 in CKD. Hyperphosphatemia in renal failure lowers blood calcium levels by several mechanisms, including extraosseous deposition of calcium and phosphate, impairment of the bone-resorbing action of PTH, and reduction in 1,25(OH) 2 D production by remaining renal tissue(harrison 18 pg 3116)</p>', 1, 'CRF', 'Pseudobypoparathyoidsm', 'Vit-D deficiency', 'Vit-D deficiency', 'Medicine', 'Endocrinology', 'deb53386-ca4b-48e0-b6de-489537df647b', 100, 3, '97.00', 29);
